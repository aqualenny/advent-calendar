  <p class="day-message">This is the first day of your calendar! I'm very sorry if you think this is cringe lol i just got quite bored. I see this photo like every day on my phone and its become a very memorable image for me. That was our last hangout before the end of year 9 and it was so cute. We went out for food and you didn't finish it so i got to eat itttttt hehehe. You had your pink shirt on and i absolutely loved that shirt. Everything about summer was just amazing i miss it so much. Summer '26 here we come. I don't know if you've already seen but there is some music on the front page that I may change occasionally. Remember to refresh your page each day before opening the next door! Anyways, I hope you have a good day and I love you very much! </p>
