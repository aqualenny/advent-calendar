    I'm backkkkk. Yeah you heard it Sophia's calendar is officially back! Sorry for the absence. 2 more days until you're going to Madrid!!! Wooooooooo. Almost there. I remember this dayyy. We went on the walk down the canal and you were scared of the people and the tunnel lol. We got a starbucks and a nice cinnamon bun and it was so goodd. Then we walked back and it was so chill. More summer things I miss I guess. Okay this was day 17. 8 more days until Christmas!
Hope your nails go okay. Love youuu.    </p>
